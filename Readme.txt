This is a simple GUI app where the app tells us "How many times a name or a string can be entered? from the random aplhabets that you enter in the text filed." 

By default this Simple Name counter app is set to a Name/String "SANJU". If you eneter random text/ alphabets in text field and submit, a message pops up saying SAnju's name can be entered so these many times", based on the aplhabets entered.

Used Netbeans IDE 8.2

Go to NameScreen.java file and replace the SANJU alphabets to your required Name/String and customise accordingly.
